# nginx-sandbox

This chart adds a basic configuration of nginx to the cluster for functional verification.

## Usage

Using the bastion pod allows you to easily test HTTP requests.

``` shell
‚ùØ kubectl exec deploy/<RELEASE_NAME>-bastion -- http -h
/usr/local/bin/http -- do http request

/usr/local/bin/http (n|nginx) N ARG [CURL_OPTS]
  curl to N-th pod of StatefulSet of nginx like:
    curl NGINX_POD_URL/ARG CURL_OPTS

/usr/local/bin/http (b|bin|httpbin) ARG [CURL_OPTS]
  curl to httpbin Service like:
    curl HTTPBIN_SERVICE_URL/ARG CURL_OPTS

/usr/local/bin/http (a|app) ARG [CURL_OPTS]
  curl to app Service like:
    curl APP_SERVICE_URL/ARG CURL_OPTS

/usr/local/bin/http ARG [CURL_OPTS]
  curl to nginx Service like:
    curl NGINX_SERVICE/ARG CURL_OPTS

If DEBUG is set, enable debug output like:
  DEBUG=1 /usr/local/bin/http /a/health
```
